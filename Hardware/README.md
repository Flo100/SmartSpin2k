V3 is the brand spanking new version where we've gone to a more rigid mount and designed a completly custom PCB with SMT components which can be manufactured using automated techniques. THe newest PCB sports a uart->serial driver to allow direct communication with Peloton bikes. 

V2 prints easier, is smaller and uses less hardware. It has a much better gear ratio than V1 and supports a carrier board PCB onto which the devkits mount for easy wiring/soldering.  

V1 is the oldest printable version. It's slightly more sophisticated than duct tape and cardboard. The common assets do not work with this version, the V1 folder includes knob cups and adaptors specific to V1. You'll probably only use this directory if you need to print replacement parts for a V1.
