smartbike2k

Hardware and Software Project that uses an ESP32 and servo motor to control spin bikes that have a resistance knob. The initial target is to get it working with Zwift (which it is).

Documentation to follow.

This is my first GitHub project and one of my first (recent) large coding projects, so any help or feedback is greatly appreciated.
