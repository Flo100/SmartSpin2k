# [SmartSpin2K Hardware]
Hardware is available in two primary versions.  V2 - The Through-Hole soldered version, can easily be DIY'ed by anyone with basic soldering and electronics experience.  V3 - Integrated PCB is new and uses a manufactured PCB with a serial interface specifically designed for integration with Peloton bikes.  It also provides a path for DIY'ers to [order a board and cable kit](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/wiki/Prebuilt-Kits) that doesn't require any soldering skills. It's "print", "plug" and "play".  Both versions share many common assets, though measurements and frame clearances vary based on the hardware being used.  

There's additional information in each folder to help you determine what parts might work best for you.
