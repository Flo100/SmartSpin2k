## [Unreleased]
- May consider relocating slide mount position on case side to make LED's visible again


## [1.2.0]
### Added
- NEW: Hex bolt mod for 40t gear and matching ic4 cup/mount.
- rename directory to something more apparent
- Removed need for support material from case
- thicker slide design.  Removes need for washers
- Slightly shorter slide - should allow more flexibility for ss2k placement on IC4.
- tighter tolerances on case and bike mount for slide fitting.  It should be a snug fit but shouldn't require force
- slightly larger diameter holes for m3 screws used in case assembly.  Screws should be much easier to insert
- additional tolerance for m5 fitting
- combined knob cup & knob insert for schwinn to reduce amount of plastic needed for the schwinn.
- added schwinn-specific support for the 5/16" HEX bolt mod - this is a drop-in replacement for the plastic printed gear + cup/holder combination.  Adds a lot of strength

### Changed
- Including a revised 11t stl - A tiny bit more clearance on inner diameter the drive shaft on my steppers.
