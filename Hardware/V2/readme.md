# [Description]
This version of SmartSpin2K is designed with DIY in mind.  The PCB can be hand soldered using readily available components.  

The case for V2 is available in multiple versions that are suitable for various needs.  The direct mount design is the currently recommended case design.

## [Direct Mount (Recommended)]
- Recommended due to additional stability provided on spherical knobs
- Requires some additional parts and components compared to the Universal Mount.  Direct mounts are available for a [variety of bikes](../Common%20Assets/Bike%20Mount/)
- Long case is suitable for bikes with a minimum of 115mm of space between the center of the knob and the head tube such as the Bowflex C6, Peloton Bike, and Echelon Connect Sport.  The shortest arm tested by the dev team is suitable for bikes with 130-150mm of clearance
- Short Case is suitable for bikes with minimum clearance of approximately 81mm - such as the Bowflex C7.  

## [Universal Mount]
- Suitable for use across numerous bikes or simply if a direct mount solution is not required in your situation.
- Minimum clearance of 49mm between the center of knob and the rear of the head tube (side closest to the cyclist)  is required

## [Ultra Short Mod]
- This is a version of Case V2 that's been shortened to allow use on bikes with less than 49mm head tube spacing.
