## [Unreleased]
- May consider a knob cup + insert mod using the 5/16" [hex bolt option](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/KnobCups), allowing for a stronger output shaft.
- May consider relocating slide mount position on case side to make LED's visible again


## [1.2.0]
### Added
- rename directory to something more apparent
- Removed need for support material from case
- thicker slide design.  Removes need for washers
- Slightly shorter slide - should allow more flexibility for ss2k placement on IC4.
- tighter tolerances on case and bike mount for slide fitting.  It should be a snug fit but shouldn't require force
- slightly larger diameter holes for m3 screws used in case assembly.  Screws should be much easier to insert
- combined knob cup & knob insert for schwinn to reduce amount of plastic and print time needed

### Changed
- Including a revised 11t stl - A tiny bit more clearance on inner diameter the drive shaft on my steppers.
