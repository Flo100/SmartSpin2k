SmartSpin2k (aka SS2K) adds automatic resistance control to any spin bike! It physically connects to your spin bike resistance control knob and then wirelessly to any apps like Zwift or Trainer Road via BLE. SS2k also has shifter buttons that allow the user to simulate shifting gears on the stationary bike and includes advanced trainer features like ERG mode! 

One of the main primary design goals of SS2k is to keep the parts count low making it easy for makers to build for themselves. 

If you'd like to get involved in SS2K but don't want to build your own, a limited number of kits are available on sale by our community members.  [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/wiki/Prebuilt-Kits) for more information.
